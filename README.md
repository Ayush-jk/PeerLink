# **PeerLink**

**PeerLink** is a secure peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application that enables real-time communication between users over encrypted SSL connections. The application allows users to register, discover other peers, and exchange messages securely in a decentralized environment.

---

## **Features**

- **Peer Registration**: Register your peer to be discovered by others in the network.  
- **Peer Discovery**: Discover active peers in the network and initiate secure connections.  
- **Secure Communication**: Messages are sent over SSL-encrypted channels to ensure privacy and data integrity.  
- **Deregistration**: Remove yourself from the network when you disconnect.  
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages in real-time, with no reliance on central servers.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The main programming language used for both server and client implementations.  
- **SSL/TLS**: For secure communication between peers.  
- **Threading**: To handle multiple client connections concurrently.

---

## **How It Works**

### **Server (`server.py`)**
- Listens for incoming connections from peers.  
- Registers peers, facilitates peer discovery, and allows deregistration.  
- Maintains a registry of active peers with timestamps to manage peer expiration.  
- Provides discovery services by sending a list of active peers when requested.

### **Client (`client.py`)**
- Registers itself with the server, making it discoverable to other peers.  
- Discovers active peers by querying the server for the list of available peers.  
- Connects to selected peers and establishes SSL-encrypted communication channels.  
- Allows sending and receiving messages securely over the established peer-to-peer connection.

## **Usage**

1. **Register a Peer**:  
   Launch the client to automatically register with the server.

2. **Discover Peers**:  
   Use the client interface to fetch a list of currently active peers.

3. **Connect to Peers**:  
   Select a peer from the list to initiate a secure messaging session.

4. **Send Messages**:  
   Communicate in real-time over the encrypted SSL channel.

5. **Deregister**:  
   Exit gracefully by deregistering your peer from the server.

## **Security Note**

While this project uses SSL for secure communication, SSL certificate and private key files are not included in this repository. You will need to generate your own certificate and key using tools like OpenSSL.
